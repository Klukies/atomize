It's important to note that Cookie Though only saves the preferences. Implementing the cookies
should be handled by you! In order to aid with this, we have written some tutorials for different
types of applications, which can be viewed [here](/docs/tutorials)

### Install Cookie Though

Install Cookie Though through npm or yarn.

```shell
# With npm
npm install cookie-though

# With yarn
yarn add cookie-though
```

### Import it

Installing Cookie Though from your terminal.
Import `init(){:js}` from `'cookie-though'{:js}`.

```js
import { init } from 'cookie-though';
```

### Initialise it

Initialise the plugin with the `init(){:js}` function to render Cookie Though.

```js
import { init } from 'cookie-though';

init();
```

## Using Cookie Though through a CDN

If you're not using a package manager, you can add Cookie Though to your site using a `<script>{:html}` tag.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { init } from 'https://cookiethough.dev/lib/<version>';

  init();
</script>
```

export default function render({ children }) {
  return <Layout frontmatter={frontmatter}>{children}</Layout>;
}
